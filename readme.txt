The best plugin for WordPress to send Device properties as Custom Dimensions to
Google Analytics to get richer insights of device specifications and capabilities.

== Description ==

Integrating 51Degrees Device Detection with your website will allow you to make
informed decisions about what content a user engages with and how it is displayed.
Combining the information learned from your analytics data with real-time
enhanced device data on your website will empower you to produce a page built
for that specific device’s needs. Taking this one step further, you have an
additional 280+ device properties available to enhance your user's user
experience. The possibilities are endless as to what you can do with the
information - it’s remarkably powerful.

This plugin makes use of the 51Degrees Pipeline API to deliver various data
intelligence [services](https://51degrees.com/services). You can also add custom
dimensions to your Google Analytics solution which will enhance your analytical
data. With 51Degrees you can capture data that Google Analytics doesn't readily
collect, such as detailed information on specific device hardware.

== Features ==

## Integration With Google Analytics

you will be able to fetch the Custom Dimensions in the Google Analytics Custom
Reports to get the useful insights.
